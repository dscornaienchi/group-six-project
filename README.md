# Lone Star Diver

## Description

This website uses server side APIs, javascript, CSS, and HTML to provide the user with destinations based upon search criteria.

The search criteria includes the star rating, the type of destination, and the intended city. When the search button is clicked, a map of the city, a weather forecast, a list of places, and associated reviews are generated. 

The goal is to provide the user with places that have bad reviews so they can find the "diamonds in the rough" within a city, and not have to worry about large crowds that they'll normally find at the places with 4-5 stars.
